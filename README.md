# audio_responsive_raymarcher
evvvvil's raymarching distance fields audio-responsive mega shader

This shader is a raymarcher rendering distance fields equations.
It basically generates live 3d geometry on the GPU pipeline in a totally procedural manner and without using any vertices or mesh.
The resulting geometry has depth and therefore can be mixed in a scene with normal poolygonal geometry.

Two different shapes can be created with this shader: one hellish fireball thing with very high detail and audio-responsive perlin displacement mapping, please see screenshots in folder called "hell_screenshot01.jpg", etc...
The other shape is an intricate procedural column aka the flahs-bang tunnel and can be viewed in its full-on glory as a gif here:
